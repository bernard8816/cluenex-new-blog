## Definition

<div class="def-box">
<p class="definition-text">
<dfn id="rsi-def"><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</strong></dfn> is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes on a scale of <data value="0">0</data> to <data value="100">100</data>, used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a security.
</p>
<div class="def-source">Source: Wilder, J.W. (1978). <em>New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.</em></div>
</div>

Developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, RSI quantifies buying and selling pressure by comparing the average magnitude of recent gains to recent losses. The indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 conventionally interpreted as overbought and readings below 30 as oversold.

Unlike price-based indicators, RSI measures only *momentum* — the rate of change. This means RSI can reveal underlying weakness in a rising stock or hidden strength in a falling one before the price action makes the shift visible.

## How RSI Works
RSI calculates the ratio of average gains to average losses over a specified lookback period, typically **14 bars**. The formula:

```
RSI = 100 − [100 ÷ (1 + RS)]
RS  = Average Gain (14 periods) ÷ Average Loss (14 periods)
```

Period selection affects sensitivity vs. reliability:

- **7–9 periods** — faster, more signals, more false signals. Suited for day trading and scalping.
- **14 periods (default)** — standard for swing trading (days to weeks).
- **21–28 periods** — slower, fewer but higher-confidence setups. Suited for position trading and weekly charts.

RSI is mean-reverting: extreme readings above 80 or below 20 rarely persist. Cluenex AI ingests RSI across the top 1,000 US-listed stocks as part of its prediction engine — the resulting short-term and long-term sentiment scores on the platform reflect RSI conditions without displaying the raw indicator.

## RSI Threshold Reference
Each RSI zone carries a distinct interpretation:

### Why Divergence Is the High-Probability Signal

Divergence is the most reliable RSI signal because it reveals a momentum shift before price confirms it.

**Bullish Divergence:** Price makes a new low, but RSI does not. Selling pressure is weakening even as price falls. Enter long when price bounces and closes above the swing high between the two lows.

**Bearish Divergence:** Price makes a new high, but RSI does not. Buying pressure is fading despite price reaching a new high. Enter short when price breaks below the swing low between the two highs.

## Common Mistakes
<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 1</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"RSI above 70 means short immediately."</strong><br>
Stocks in strong uptrends remain above 70 for extended periods. RSI 70+ is a warning — tighten stops, take partial profits. Wait for bearish divergence or a close back below 70 before shorting.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 2</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"RSI below 30 is always a buy."</strong><br>
Stocks in steep downtrends stay below 30 for weeks. Blindly buying at RSI 30 catches falling knives. Wait for bullish divergence or a confirmed close above 30 before entering long.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 3</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"14-period default works on all timeframes."</strong><br>
A 14-period RSI on a 1-minute chart is too slow. Use 5–7 periods for sub-hourly timeframes; 21–28 for weekly/monthly charts.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 4</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"I should trade RSI in isolation."</strong><br>
RSI alone leads to whipsaws. Pair with volume, trend direction, support/resistance, or — on Cluenex — check the short-term and long-term sentiment scores, which already incorporate RSI analysis.</p>

## How Cluenex Uses RSI
Cluenex AI ingests RSI as one of its core inputs when calculating predicted short-term and long-term price movement for each stock. While RSI itself isn't displayed directly on the Cluenex platform, the AI digests it — alongside dozens of other signals — so every sentiment score and price forecast you see already reflects RSI momentum analysis beneath the surface.

When RSI signals overbought or oversold conditions, or when divergence forms, those signals feed directly into Cluenex's short-term and long-term prediction models. The sentiment scores visible on the platform are the AI's synthesized output of all these inputs, including RSI. Cluenex AI also processes all of this even for metrics not visible on the frontend — because the AI digests everything to deliver the most accurate prediction.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **What's the difference between a 14-period RSI and a 7-period RSI?**
  A 14-period RSI is slower and less responsive, producing fewer signals and fewer false positives. A 7-period RSI reacts faster to recent price action, producing more signals but also more false signals. Use 14 for swing trading (days to weeks) and 7 or 9 for day trading or scalping.

- **Is RSI more effective on stocks or crypto?**
  RSI works on both, but crypto exhibits more extreme moves. Cryptoassets stay above RSI 70 and below RSI 30 longer than equities, so crypto traders often adjust thresholds to 80/20 instead of 70/30. Equities tend to respect the traditional 70/30 levels more consistently.

- **Can RSI predict a crash?**
  RSI cannot predict the magnitude or timing of crashes, but extreme RSI readings (above 85 or below 15) combined with bearish divergence often precede sharp reversals. During market crashes, RSI may hit 5–10, but trying to bottom-pick with only RSI is dangerous. Always use stop losses.

- **Should I use RSI on a 1-minute chart?**
  Yes, but use a 5 or 7-period RSI instead of 14. Shorter timeframes require shorter lookback windows. A 14-period RSI on a 1-minute chart is too slow and lags price moves, making entries late.

- **What's the success rate of RSI overbought/oversold signals?**
  Overbought and oversold signals alone have a roughly 50% win rate — little better than a coin flip. When combined with divergence, price action confirmation, or additional indicators (volume, sentiment scores), the win rate climbs to 65–75%.

- **Does RSI work on all stocks or only liquid ones?**
  RSI works best on liquid, heavily-traded stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA). Illiquid or low-volume stocks produce choppy RSI that whipsaws frequently. Always check average daily volume before relying on RSI signals.
