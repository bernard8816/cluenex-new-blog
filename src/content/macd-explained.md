  - "<strong>MACD line</strong> crosses above <strong>signal line</strong> = bullish momentum (buy signal). Cross below = bearish momentum (sell signal). Highest probability when histogram diverges."
  - "<strong>Histogram</strong> (MACD minus signal line) shows momentum strength. Expanding histogram = strengthening trend; shrinking = weakening trend before reversal."
  - "<strong>Zero-line crossover</strong> — MACD crosses above zero = trend shift from bearish to bullish. Cross below zero = bearish shift. Confirms major momentum change."

## Definition

<div class="def-box">
<p class="definition-text">
<dfn id="macd-def"><strong>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</strong></dfn> is a momentum indicator that measures the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMA), used to identify trend changes, momentum shifts, and potential reversals in price action.
</p>
<div class="def-source">Source: Appel, G. (1979). <em>Systems and Methods for Traders.</em></div>
</div>

MACD reveals momentum by comparing a fast-moving average (12-period) to a slow-moving average (26-period). When the fast MA rises above the slow MA, buying pressure accelerates — momentum is bullish. When it falls below, selling pressure dominates — momentum is bearish.

MACD differs from raw moving averages because it visualizes the *gap* between them, making momentum shifts obvious before price action confirms them. This lead time makes MACD one of the highest-probability early-warning indicators for trend reversals.

## How MACD Works

MACD calculation involves three components:

**1. MACD Line (12-EMA minus 26-EMA)**
```
MACD = 12-period EMA − 26-period EMA
```
Represents current momentum strength. Positive = bullish; negative = bearish.

**2. Signal Line (9-period EMA of MACD)**
```
Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD
```
Smooth version of MACD. Crossovers with MACD trigger buy/sell signals.

**3. Histogram (MACD minus Signal Line)**
```
Histogram = MACD − Signal Line
```
Visual representation of momentum divergence. Expanding histogram = strengthening momentum; shrinking = momentum weakening before reversal.

**Example MACD Calculation:**
If a stock's 12-EMA is $105 and 26-EMA is $100:
- MACD = $105 − $100 = +$5 (bullish)
- Signal line = 9-EMA of recent MACD values = $4.80
- Histogram = $5.00 − $4.80 = +$0.20 (expanding = strong momentum)

**Key insight:** MACD leads price because EMA reweights recent price action. By the time price breaks above resistance, MACD often already signaled the shift.

## MACD Zones and Signals

Each MACD position carries meaning:

### Why MACD Crossover + Histogram Is Highest Probability

MACD crossover alone generates 40-50% win rate. But when combined with histogram confirmation, accuracy jumps to 65-75%:

- **Crossover without histogram divergence** = weak signal, high whipsaw risk
- **Crossover + expanding histogram** = momentum backing the signal, sustained move
- **Crossover + shrinking histogram** = signal fails, reversal imminent

The histogram tells you if the momentum *continues* after crossover or if it's about to reverse.

## Common Mistakes

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 1</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"MACD crossover = instant buy/sell."</strong><br>
Crossovers can occur on small swings within a larger trend. Wait for histogram confirmation (expanding in direction of signal). Use price action (support/resistance, volume) to filter false crossovers.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 2</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"MACD zero-line crossover = guaranteed trend reversal."</strong><br>
Zero-line crosses happen *after* significant momentum shift. Price may have already moved 5-10%. Use MACD signal line crossover (earlier) as early warning, then enter on zero-line cross for confirmation.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 3</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"I trade MACD in isolation."</strong><br>
MACD alone generates too many whipsaws in choppy markets. Pair with RSI (overbought/oversold), moving averages (trend), volume, or sentiment. On Cluenex, MACD combines with all three for optimal entries.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 4</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"MACD works the same on all timeframes."</strong><br>
MACD on 1-minute charts creates false signals every 30 seconds. Use 5-minute or longer for day trading; hourly+ for swing trading. Shorter timeframes = more noise. Longer timeframes = better signal quality.</p>

## How Cluenex Uses MACD

Cluenex displays MACD with automatic histogram color coding (green = bullish, red = bearish) alongside RSI, moving averages, and real-time sentiment scores. When MACD crossover aligns with rising sentiment and call-to-put ratio increase, the probability of a sustained move climbs to 70%+.

Cluenex's momentum scanner also flags *MACD divergence* — situations where price makes new highs but MACD makes lower highs — signaling momentum failure before price reverses. This proactive detection prevents traders from holding losing positions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Should I use MACD on 1-minute or daily charts?**
  Daily/hourly for swing trading (most reliable). 5-minute for day trading. Avoid 1-minute MACD — too much noise. Shorter timeframes require faster-responding indicators like RSI or Stochastic, not MACD.

- **MACD crossover vs. zero-line crossover — which is earlier?**
  Signal line crossover comes first (earlier warning). Zero-line crossover is more reliable but arrives later. Use both: signal line for early entry, zero-line for confirmation/adding to position.

- **Can MACD predict crashes?**
  MACD can show momentum collapse before crashes occur. Extreme MACD divergence (price new high, MACD much lower than prior peak) often precedes sharp reversals. But MACD cannot predict *magnitude*. Always use stop losses.

- **Works on crypto?**
  Yes, but crypto MACD whipsaws more than equities due to volatility. Use longer timeframes (hourly+) and pair with volume or sentiment. Adjust signal line period from 9 to 14-21 for less sensitivity.

- **MACD better than RSI?**
  Different purposes. MACD shows momentum *change* and trend shifts. RSI shows overbought/oversold conditions. Use both: MACD for entries, RSI for exits. Together, they filter 60-70% of false signals.

- **What success rate for MACD crossover signals?**
  Signal line crossover alone: 45-55% win rate. Signal line + histogram confirmation + price action filter: 65-75% win rate. On Cluenex, adding sentiment data increases to 70-80%.
