  - "<strong>Bollinger Bands</strong> = 20-period MA ± <data value=\"2\">2</data> standard deviations. Middle band = trend; upper/lower bands = support/resistance extremes."
  - "<strong>Squeeze</strong> (bands close together) = low volatility, trend paused. Precedes <data value=\"70\">70</data>%+ of major breakouts. Most reliable setup."
  - "<strong>Band breakout</strong> = price closes outside upper or lower band. Signals volatility expansion + new trend beginning. High probability if confirmed by volume."
  - "<strong>Band bounce</strong> = price bounces off middle band in range-bound market. Mid-band = dynamic support/resistance. Traders fade extremes here."

## Definition

<div class="def-box">
<p class="definition-text">
<dfn id="bollinger-bands-def"><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong></dfn> are a volatility indicator consisting of a <data value="20">20</data>-period simple moving average (middle band) with upper and lower bands plotted <data value="2">2</data> standard deviations above and below, used to identify overbought/oversold extremes, volatility squeezes, and breakout opportunities.

</div>

Bollinger Bands measure volatility by expanding and contracting around price. Wide bands = high volatility; narrow bands = low volatility. When bands squeeze together, volatility has compressed to historic lows — a precursor to explosive moves. When bands expand, volatility is rising and trends accelerate. Bollinger Bands reveal both *when* moves are about to happen (squeezes) and *how strong* moves are (band width).

## How Bollinger Bands Work

**Three components:**

1. **Middle Band** — <data value="20">20</data>-period simple moving average. Acts as dynamic support/resistance and trend identifier.
2. **Upper Band** — Middle band + (2 × standard deviation). Price rarely stays above; when it does, overbought condition exists.
3. **Lower Band** — Middle band − (2 × standard deviation). Price rarely drops below; when it does, oversold condition exists.

**Standard deviation** measures how far price typically moves from the average. Higher standard deviation = wider bands = more volatility. Lower standard deviation = tighter bands = less volatility.

**Key insight:** Price spends ~95% of time inside the bands and only ~5% outside. When price touches/crosses a band, it's an extreme and often reverses or accelerates (depending on context).

| Pattern | Bands | Volatility | What It Means |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Squeeze** | Very tight, bands nearly touching | Historically low | Volatility about to expand. Big move coming. |
| **Normal width** | Bands moderate distance apart | Average volatility | Trend established. Momentum running. |
| **Expansion** | Bands far apart, widening | High volatility | Trend accelerating. Strong breakout underway. |
| **Upper band touch** | Price at or above upper band | Rising | Overbought. Pullback likely OR trend continues strong. |
| **Lower band touch** | Price at or below lower band | Rising | Oversold. Bounce likely OR trend continues strong. |

## How to Use Bollinger Bands in Practice

### Squeeze to Breakout Setup

1. **Identify squeeze** — Bands tighter than they've been in 20+ days. Price moving sideways.
2. **Wait for volatility spike** — Price closes outside upper or lower band on volume.
3. **Confirm direction** — If upper band break on high volume = bullish breakout. If lower band break on high volume = bearish breakout.
4. **Enter in direction of break** — Long if upper break; short if lower break.
5. **Stop loss:** Opposite band or recent swing (whichever closer).
6. **Target:** Bands often widen 2–3x during breakout. Exit when bands widen significantly or when price retraces back to middle band.

**Win rate:** 70–75% when squeeze + volume breakout occur.

### Band Bounce Setup (Range-Bound Markets)

1. **Check if in range** — Price bouncing between middle and upper band (bullish range) or middle and lower band (bearish range).
2. **Wait for touch of extreme band** — Price touches upper band in bullish range, or lower band in bearish range.
3. **Fade the extreme** — Short upper band touch in bullish range (expect bounce to middle); long lower band touch in bearish range.
4. **Target:** Middle band (20-MA).
5. **Stop loss:** Beyond the band that was touched.

**Win rate:** 60–65% in range-bound markets.

## Common Mistakes

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 1</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"Price at upper band = always sell; price at lower band = always buy."</strong><br>
Bollinger Band extremes in strong trends sustain. Price can walk along upper band for weeks in uptrend. Reality: Check trend direction first. In uptrends, upper band touch = support, not resistance. In downtrends, lower band touch = resistance, not support.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 2</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"All squeezes lead to big breakouts."</strong><br>
Squeeze = volatility about to expand. But direction unpredictable. Some squeezes break up; some break down. Reality: Squeeze alone isn't directional. Pair with RSI, MACD, or sentiment to predict breakout direction.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 3</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"I use default <data value=\"20\">20</data>-period bands on all timeframes."</strong><br>
Default works on daily/weekly. On 1-minute, <data value=\"20\">20</data> periods = 20 minutes = too slow. On monthly, <data value=\"20\">20</data> periods = too much data. Reality: Adjust period to timeframe. Use 5-period bands on 1-min; 50-period on weekly.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-red">
<div class="callout-label">✗ Mistake 4</div>
<p class="callout-text"><strong>"Bollinger Band squeeze + no volume confirmation = trade it."</strong><br>
Squeeze without volume breakout = false signal. Price bounces within squeeze. Reality: Squeeze is setup; volume breakout is trigger. No volume, no entry.</p>

## How Cluenex Uses Bollinger Bands

Cluenex AI ingests Bollinger Band data — including squeeze detection, band width, and breakout signals — as a core input when calculating predicted short-term and long-term price movement for each stock. Bollinger Bands aren't displayed directly on the Cluenex platform, but the AI processes band compression and expansion across the top 1,000 US-listed stocks continuously.

When a squeeze forms or a band breakout triggers, those signals feed directly into Cluenex's prediction models. The sentiment scores and price forecasts visible on the platform already reflect this analysis. Cluenex AI digests all of these metrics — even those not shown on the frontend — to deliver the most accurate short-term and long-term price movement forecasts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **What's the difference between Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels?**
  Both measure volatility, but Bollinger Bands use standard deviation; Keltner Channels use Average True Range (ATR). Bollinger Bands tighter in low-volatility markets; Keltner more stable across volatility regimes. Try both, pick the one that fits your trading style.

- **Can I use Bollinger Bands on crypto?**
  Yes. Crypto more volatile, so squeezes are tighter and breakouts more explosive. Use the same setup: wait for squeeze, volume breakout, then ride the trend. Timeframe: 4-hour or daily; avoid 1-minute (too much noise).

- **Should I change the standard deviation from 2 to something else?**
  2 standard deviations is standard for good reason — price spends ~95% of time inside. Going to 1.5 or 2.5 changes sensitivity but doesn't improve results. Stick with 2.

- **What if price closes outside upper band but on low volume?**
  False breakout. Low volume = weak buying. Price likely retreats back inside the band within 1–2 bars. Skip the trade.

- **How do I know if a squeeze will break up or down?**
  Bollinger Bands don't tell direction. Use RSI, MACD, or sentiment to predict breakout direction. Squeeze = volatility expansion coming; indicators tell you which way.

- **Can I use Bollinger Bands for stop-loss placement?**
  Yes. In an uptrend, use the lower band as stop loss. In downtrend, use upper band. Bands adjust dynamically, so stops tighten in low-volatility and widen in high-volatility — natural position management.
